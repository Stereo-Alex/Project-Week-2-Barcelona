## Project Description
In this project we aim to explore the relationship between the rise of covid-19 and the fall of hand to hand business as well as the effect that might have had in the growth of online retail in the grater Barcelona area. To do this we decided to explore the employment levels by area since it was the best metric to determine the direct impact of covid.

## Questions & Hypotheses
To do what we have outlined we decided to present two different hypothesis.

First: The fall of physical shops and retail due to Corona has had a direct relation with the rise of Online businesses and consumption in the greater Barcelona Area.

Second: The Increase in Covid cases and restrictions has had a direct impact on unemployment in more lower income areas

## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

## Workflow
Mostly followed the guidelines layed out by the project, but also ended up using a Kanban board to limit our work and set deadlines. 

#### Day 1:
We chose the the topic of Economics and Buisness out of the provided list and we brainstormed ideas that we thought would be relevant to the topic, mostly relating shifts in the current economy as well as the impact of Covid.
We also set up our Kaban table in trello and specified the tasks we foresaw doing on each of the days as well as tasks we saw that could come up during our worktime.

#### Day 2:
We narrowed down the topics we selected and settled on two hipothesis. We then took a deep dive onto the resources section as well as other databases like "eurostat" to be able to find data to back up the expected outcomes of our hypothesis.
We also setup a working project out of which both of us could work from. This way we could put our work together without having to depend on anything other than GitHub. We created two separate folders to separate workspaces and avoid stepping on each others toes 

#### Day 3:
We started coding and working with our selected data sets, we cleaned our data to be able to use it on the fourth day and minimize the work interpreting it.

#### Day 4:

#### Day 5: 


## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

We divided up our repository to not interfere with each others work into two folders that we set up as separate work spaces. 

We set up a Kanban board in Trello which we both could use to work from and share the data we found under the respective sources.
